title: "How to recognize a good programmer"
---
Daniel from intersections has posted a [nice article](http://www.inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good-programmer/)
on the telling signs of a good programmer. The article is aimed at business people, but is a good read for
developers meaning to hire as well.
