<blockquote>
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

	 -- Lao-tzu, The Way of Lao-tzu (604 BC - 531 BC)
</blockquote>

This wisdom still holds true even after 2600 years. Though fellow software developers may be more familiar with this version:
<blockquote>
A project of a thousand lines begins with "Hello World!".

	-- Kernighan, Tutorial to B (1972)
</blockquote>
