title: "symfony 1.0 and PHP 5.3 the 2nd"
---
In my last post I was still getting the following error when using a symfony1.0 project with php5.3

	Warning: substr() expects parameter 2 to be long, string given in ..\lib\vendor\symfony\lib\vendor\propel\map\TableMap.php on line 303

Turned out that substr was erroneously used instead of strstr. Changed that in the line mentioned above and everything worked like a charm.
