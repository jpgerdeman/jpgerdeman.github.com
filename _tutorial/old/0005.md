More Action
===

Well it would be nice if we could do more than display the username. Let's add more stuff.

We'll pass a new query parameter `action` to our script. Depending on the action we will
either greet our user or show him his profile.

So depending on the `action` parameter we will either greet a user - defined by the `uname` parameter - or display his profile.

Implementing this new action should be fairly easy with what has been introduced up till now. Just use
an if statement to decide which action to use. 

Make sure you have understood everything so far, because the next steps will radically change our code.
