From Hello world to Framework
=============================

In this series of posts we'll be exploring creating a Full Framework from a simple
"Hello World" statement. Each step will build on the previous, and by examining
our code or by evaluating "requirements" we will identify faults in the code,
which in turn will leed to the next step.

Of course the presented steps will not be the only possible resolutions to the
identified problems. The rich abundance of Frameworks and languages is proof of
this.

This course is meant for beginners and green developers. The resulting framework
will work, but will lack, especially in means of security.

**Do not use the resulting framework of this course in production.**

At any point feel free to comment.

## Let's Begin
Our Journey will begin, as so many others have as well, with a greeting.
